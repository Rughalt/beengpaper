## Beengpaper

Beengpaper (pronounced *bingpaper*) is a small macOS menu bar
application that downloads the daily wallpaper from Bing and sets it on
all of your desktops.

### Requirements
Beengpaper requires macOS El Captain (10.11) or later.

### Installation 

Download the application here, open `.dmg` file and drag and drop the
app into Applications folder.

### Building the app yourself

Beengpaper is written in Python (Python 3.7), using rumps and appscript
libraries. Additionally you need py2app to build the application package
and create-dmg (awesome little tool for creating dmg files you can find
[here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg)).

```
git clone
cd beengpaper
python setup.py py2app
```

### FAQ
**Q. But why?**

A. Because I got bored one sunday morning, and I like Bing wallpapers.

**Q. Names in the menu change but application does not change my
wallpaper**

A. This may be caused by one of three things:
- You did not allow application access to System Events when it first
  asked (you can change it under Preferences > Security)
- Your current wallpaper setting is "Change wallpaper every ..." in
  macOS preferences. Set wallpaper to static image to allow Beengpaper
  to work
- Application broke because something changed in Bing stream. If you
  think your problem is not related to two above, pleas open an issue on
  GitHub.
 
**Q. How can I make Beengpaper launch on startup?**

A. Unfortunately, Beengpaper cannot set itself as a launch program. You
can however easily make it launch on login using macOS Preferences pane.
Navigate to Preferences > Users and Groups > Login and add Beengpaper.
